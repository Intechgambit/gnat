## Genomic Intelligence Analytics Tool (GIAT)

GIAT is a user-friendly Python Flet desktop application developed by Intechgambit to streamline your genomic data analysis workflow. It enables you to:

- Process genomic data: Analyze both DNA and RNA sequences.
- Retrieve data from NCBI Entrez: Leverage the power of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez databases using the integrated Entrez API.
- Create custom BLAST databases: Generate searchable databases optimized for BLAST searches.
- Perform taxonomic assignments and annotations: Efficiently assign taxonomic classifications and enrich your data with annotations.
- Generate visualizations: Create informative visualizations to gain deeper insights from your genomic data.
- Convert data to FASTA format: Seamlessly convert your data into the FASTA format for NCBI BLAST compatibility.
## Leveraging NCBI Entrez Downloads

GIAT integrates seamlessly with NCBI Entrez databases, allowing you to either use their resources independently or combine them with your own datasets. This powerful combination facilitates the creation of robust, searchable BLAST databases and relational databases. These databases are invaluable for tasks such as annotation, taxonomic classification, and analysis.

## User-Friendly Interface: Species Boards

GIAT prioritizes user experience with its intuitive Species Boards feature. These boards serve as convenient containers for defining search parameters used to retrieve data from NCBI databases via their Entrez API. Here's how to utilize them effectively:

1. Board Management: Access the Board Manager from your Workspace. This section serves as your central hub for managing Species Boards.
2. Create or Select a Board:
- To create a new board, click "Add new board" and provide a descriptive name. Optionally, choose a color to visually differentiate your lists.
- To use an existing board, simply click on its name.
3. Define Species Search: Enter the species name you intend to investigate. This name will serve as a label for all output activities associated with this specific search.
4. Craft Search Queries:
- Search queries represent parameters directly translated into NCBI database searches. You can create multiple queries within a single list, with each iteratively searching for items fulfilling those parameters.
- Unsure how to formulate queries? No problem! Visit the NCBI website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), select the Nucleotide database, define your search terms and filters, and copy the displayed "Search details" text. Paste this into the tool's search query field.
5. Manage Your Lists:
- Click the three dots located in the top right corner of a list to access its options. Here, you can edit the list name, delete it, or trigger a data download using the "Get data" function.
6. Monitoring Downloads: Gain visibility into download progress and track the status of your data retrieval requests.
Additional Notes: (Will include the installation).
